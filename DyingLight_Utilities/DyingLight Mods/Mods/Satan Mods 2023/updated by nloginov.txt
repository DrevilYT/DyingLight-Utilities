Took the original 2018 datapak from Satan and updated it to the newest game version.

There is a possibility of some crashes, although it works pretty much stable for me.

Updated mostly via WinMerge. BIN Editor for text files and side-by-side view in Sublime Text for miscellaneous things.

Tried to keep everything as original as possible, didn't edit anything in the files except adding my small little unnoticeable copyright.
