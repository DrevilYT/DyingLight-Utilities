This program lets you automatically install all of the mods listed here in a matter of seconds.

It's a legit nice and comfortable tool which I now use personally for myself, just lets me install my tools a lot easier.

You don't have to specify any paths or something like that. This tool automatically finds your game's directory! (Steam & Epic Games supported)

For anyone saying that it's a virus, here's the source code: https://github.com/womblee/auto-mod-downloader
